  <p>Hi, I’m Rekha. Beepad is my digital notebook a place where I turn complex topics into simple explanations. I write about Python, DevOps, AWS, and Kubernetes, and I share small projects I build along the way.</p>

  <p>I like documenting things clearly so I (and others) can revisit and learn faster. When I’m not writing notes, I’m experimenting, reading docs, and organizing what I learn.</p>

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
